<h1> To_Do_list_app </h1>

Simple app with simple code to have a basic understanding of how Django works.

Requirements:
Python, Django

Operations:
- Add item in to-do list
- Update title and completion status of already added tasks
- Delete task
- Tasks having status as 'Completed' will show as text with strike-through

Note : It is not a very fancy version of 'To do List'. Scope of improvement is there. :)
